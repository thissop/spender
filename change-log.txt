# train_sdss.py
- changed z_max from 0.5 to 2.0 
- changed tags in data loader functions to train and valid. 
```
trainloader = SDSS.get_data_loader(args.dir, tag="train", which="train",
validloader = SDSS.get_data_loader(args.dir, tag="valid", which="valid",
```

# util.py
- 

# sdss.py 
- temporarily named classname to BOSS 
```
classname = cls.__mro__[0].__name__
filename = f"{classname}{tag}_*.pkl"
```

- changed how `batch_files` is found
```
#batch_files = glob.glob(dir + "/" + filename)
batch_files = []

for pickle_file in os.listdir(dir):
    if pickle_file.split('_')[0] == f'{classname}{tag}' and pickle_file.split('.')[-1] = '.pkl':
        batch_files.append(os.path.join(dir, pickle_file))
```

- changed it just to return batches 

```
accelerator = Accelerator(mixed_precision='fp16', cpu=True) # changed cpu to True? --> i reverted to having cpu=False
```
